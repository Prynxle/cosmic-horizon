                            <p>The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, except for Earth, 
                                were named after Greek and Roman gods and goddesses.
                                However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, which simply means "the ground."</p>

                            <h3>Potential for Life</h3>
                            <p>Earth has a very hospitable temperature and mix of chemicals that have made life abundant here. 
                                Most notably, Earth is unique in that most of our planet is covered in liquid water, since the temperature allows liquid water to exist for extended periods of time. 
                                Earth's vast oceans provided a convenient place for life to begin about 3.8 billion years ago.</p>

                            <p>Pluto was named after the Roman god of the underworld. The name was suggested by an 11-year-old schoolgirl, Venetia Burney, 
                                who was interested in classical mythology. The name was officially adopted in 1930.</p>

                            <p>Once considered the ninth planet, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006. 
                                It's the largest known dwarf planet in our solar system and the second-most-massive known dwarf planet after Eris.</p>
