                            <h3>Environmental Sustainability</h3>
                            <p>Earth's remarkable position in our solar system has created the perfect conditions for life to flourish within its balanced ecosystems.
                                 Today, these delicate systems face unprecedented threats from human activity through pollution, deforestation, and carbon emissions.
                                  My website project aims to reconnect digital citizens with our planetary home by visualizing the impact of individual choices on Earth's 
                                  health. Through interactive tools showing how technology consumption affects resource extraction and climate patterns, users can understand 
                                  their environmental footprint and discover meaningful ways to reduce harm. The platform integrates Indigenous ecological knowledge with 
                                  scientific data, honoring our planet as both life-giver and home rather than merely a resource to exploit. By fostering digital community 
                                  around Earth stewardship, the site demonstrates how technology can help rebuild our relationship with "the ground" beneath us—a fitting 
                                  reflection of Earth's own Germanic etymology—while inspiring collective action toward a sustainable future where technology serves rather 
                                  than harms our planet's natural balance.</p>

                            <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known astronomical object to harbor life. 
                                It's a rocky planet with a diverse surface, including land, 
                                water, and a breathable atmosphere.</p>

                            <p>Pluto was named after the Roman god of the underworld. The name was suggested by an 11-year-old schoolgirl, Venetia Burney, 
                                who was interested in classical mythology. The name was officially adopted in 1930.</p>

                            <h3>Classification</h3>
                            <p>Once considered the ninth planet, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006. 
                                It's the largest known dwarf planet in our solar system and the second-most-massive known dwarf planet after Eris.</p>

                                It has a thin atmosphere that expands when it comes closer to the Sun and collapses as it moves farther away.</p>
