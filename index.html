                        <h3>Namesake</h3>
                        <p>The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, except for Earth, 
                            were named after Greek and Roman gods and goddesses.
                             However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, which simply means "the ground."</p>

                        <h3>Potential for Life</h3>
                        <p>Earth has a very hospitable temperature and mix of chemicals that have made life abundant here. 
                            Most notably, Earth is unique in that most of our planet is covered in liquid water, since the temperature allows liquid water to exist for extended periods of time. 
                            Earth's vast oceans provided a convenient place for life to begin about 3.8 billion years ago.
                            Some of the features of our planet that make it great for sustaining life are changing due to the ongoing effects of climate change.</p>

                        <h3>Size and Distance</h3>
                        <p>With an equatorial diameter of 7926 miles (12,760 kilometers), Earth is the biggest of the terrestrial planets and the fifth largest planet in our solar system.
        
                            From an average distance of 93 million miles (150 million kilometers), Earth is exactly one astronomical unit away from the Sun because one astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. This unit provides an easy way to quickly compare planets' distances from the Sun.
                            
                            It takes about eight minutes for light from the Sun to reach our planet.</p>

                        <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known astronomical object to harbor life. 
                            It's a rocky planet with a diverse surface, including land, 
                            water, and a breathable atmosphere.</p>
